            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Syfy project consists of client-side components and a server-side componenet. I created two client-sides, one was built with Angular and the other with React. The server-side was built with Express (Node.js framework) and MongoDB, a non-relational/NoSQL database management program.</p>
            <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make two client-sides using the JavaScript frameworks/libraries Angular and React, both of which would use the server-side that I created for this project. I chose Syfy movies because there are are already public movie APIs, so I wanted my movie API to be more niche and just only have movies created by Syfy, an American basic cable channel. Syfy is most famous for their Sharknado series.</p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to learn how to make full-stack applications and to understand how they work.</p>

            <h2>Server-Side</h2>
            <p>The backend consists of the server, business logic, and business
              layers of the Syfy application. The REST API was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The REST API interacts with the non-relational/NoSQL database that I created with MongoDB. It interacts with my database through HTTP calls and common CRUD functions: create, read, update, delete. Mongoose is used to help with interactions.

            <h2>Angular Client-Side</h2>
            <p>After completion of the REST API, I built the client-side with the MEAN stack. It is a responsive single-page application designed with Angular Material and SCSS. Anyone interested in creating an account can easily register and delete their account whenever they please. Registered users can view information about moviees and their respective genres and directors. Users can also update their profile information and add or delete movies to and from their favorites.</p>

          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            This is the server-side component of my "Syfy" movies web
            application. It was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and
            MongoDB.
          </p>
          <h1>Objective</h1>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to learn the anatomy of REST and the creation process of RESTful API. 
          </p>
          <h1>Purpose & Context</h1>
          <p>
            I wanted to put this project on my portfolio and use it for the
            client-sides that I'll later create, so I can have projects that
            utilize two popular software stacks that contain both frontend and
            backend: MERN and MEAN.
          </p>
          <h1>API Design</h1>
          <p>
            The backend consists of the server, business logic, and business
            layers of the Syfy application. The REST API and architected
            database was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
            The REST API interacts with the non-relational/NoSQL database that I
            created with MongoDB. CRUD methods are used to retrieve, store, and
            manipulate stored data in the database.
