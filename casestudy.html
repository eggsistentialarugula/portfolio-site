          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project was created with the
            <span class="bold">MEAN</span> stack.
          </p>
          <ul class="featureList">

          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p>
            I wanted to make two client-sides using the JavaScript
            frameworks/libraries Angular and React, both of which would use the
            server-side that I created for this project. I chose Syfy movies
            because there are already public movie APIs, so I wanted my movie
            API to be more niche and just only have movies created by or hosted
            on Syfy, an American basic cable channel. Syfy is most famous for
            their Sharknado series.
          </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            I created this project so that I can understand the
            <span class="bold">MEAN</span> stack components and have first-hand
            experience in architecting an application that utilizes the stack.

          <ul class="featureList">
            <li><span class="bold blue-green">Database</span> - MongoDB</li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold blue-green">Application Server</span> - Node.js
              and Express. Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for the backend.

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold blue-green">Frontend</span> - Angular
              <span class="vermillion bold">|</span> Language: TypeScript
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The backend consists of a REST API that was built using JavaScript,
            Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The REST API interacts with the
            non-relational/NoSQL database that I created with MongoDB. It
            interacts with my database through HTTP calls and common CRUD
            functions: create, read, update, delete. Mongoose is used to
            interact with the data through Mongoose models.

            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The API was tested with Postman. I included user authentication and
            authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT
            authentication.
          </p>
          <h2>Why I chose MEAN</h2>
          <p>
            The MEAN stack combines some of the best modern web technologies
            into a powerful and flexbile stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Node.js is the foundation of this stack. It contains a built-in HTTP
            server library, which means that you don't need to run a separate
            web server program such as Apache. This gives the developer greater
            control of how their web server works. Node.js is extremely
            efficient and uses fewer server resources compared to other
            mtainstream server technologies, when coded correctly. Express is
            the Node web app framework, and together with Node.js, they underpin
            the entire stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. It uses a
            non-relational approach, so it's less-structured as opposed to a
            relational database (such as SQL), which means that a collection of
            documents can have a wide variety of data inside. Applications need
            structure to their data, so this is where Mongoose comes in -
            Mongoose defines a schema for the documents.

          <p>
            After completion of the REST API, I built the client-side with the
            MEAN stack. It is a responsive single-page application designed with
            Angular Material and SCSS. Anyone interested in creating an account
            can easily register and delete their account whenever they please.
            Registered users can view information about moviees and their
            respective genres and directors. Users can also update their profile
            information and add or delete movies to and from their favorites.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          This project came with a set of challenges that I would like to tackle
          again in future projects. I had a long-lasting CORS error and I hope I
          don't encounter it again in the future. I really like how TypeScript
          is object-oriented, it felt more logical and organized than JavaScript
          itself.
