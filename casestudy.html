            These projects were created with the
            <span class="bold">MEAN</span> and
            <span class="bold">MERN</span> stack.

          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p>
            I wanted to make two client-sides using the JavaScript
            frameworks/libraries Angular and React, both of which would use two
            server-sides that I respectively created for both of the
            client-sides. I chose Syfy movies because there are already public
            movie APIs, so I wanted my movie API to be more niche and just only
            have movies created by or hosted on Syfy, an American basic cable
            channel. Syfy is most famous for their Sharknado series.
          </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            I created this project so that I can understand the
            <span class="bold">MEAN</span> and
            <span class="bold">MERN</span> stack components and have first-hand
            experience in architecting an application that utilizes these
            stacks.

          <p>
            The backends for each client-side consists of a REST API that was
            built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The REST API
            interacts with the non-relational/NoSQL database that I created with
            MongoDB. It interacts with my database through HTTP calls and common
            CRUD functions: create, read, update, delete. Mongoose is used to
            interact with the data through Mongoose models.

            The API was tested with Postman. I included user authentication and
            authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT
            authentication.
          </p>
          <h2>Why I chose MEAN and MERN</h2>
          <p>
            These stacks combine some of the best modern web technologies into a
            powerful and flexbile stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Node.js is the foundation of this stack. It contains a built-in HTTP
            server library, which means that I didn't need to run a separate web
            server program such as Apache. This gave me more control on how the
            web server works. Node.js is extremely efficient and uses fewer
            server resources compared to other mtainstream server technologies,
            when coded correctly. Express is the Node web app framework, and
            together with Node.js, they underpin the entire stack of my project.
          </p>
          <p>
            MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. It uses a
            non-relational approach, so it's less-structured as opposed to a
            relational database (such as SQL), which means that a collection of
            documents can have a wide variety of data inside - this made the
            creation of the database more flexible for me. Applications need
            structure to their data, so this is where Mongoose comes in - I used
            Mongoose to define schema for the documents.

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          It's hard to decide what the most challenging aspect of this project
          was, because I thought it was challenging entirely. React Redux was
          very confusing and I'm going to have to do more studying on it. It was
          my first time creating a full-stack application. But it felt great
          when I finished and it's very fun and exciting to overcome all the
          errors and obstacles while making these projects, so I will definitely
          be making more full-stack projects during my free time in order to
          improve and become more familiar with the JavaScript ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          My takeaway from creating these projects is that I have a preference
          for Angular. While making the Angular project, I realized that Object
          Oriented programming feels more organized and efficient. These were my
          first projects created wth React and Angular though, so I might change
          my mind in the future after I create more applications with them.
